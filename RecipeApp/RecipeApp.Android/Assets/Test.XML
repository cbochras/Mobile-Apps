    <ingredients>2 strips bacon
2 eggs
1 flour tortillas
1 slice cheddar cheese</ingredients>
    <steps>On medium heat, fry bacon on skillet or frying pan until crispy, about 5-10 minutes. Remove bacon from frying pan and drain excess fat
Beat eggs in mixing bowl. Pour eggs onto same frying pan on medium heat. As eggs begin to set, begin to gently pull eggs across to pan to form curds. Continue cooking the eggs and gently pull and fold the eggs until they begin to set. Continue this process until no liquid remains. Do not stir constantly. About 2 minutes. Add cheese on top of scrambled eggs to begin melting and remove from heat. Leave pan on stovetop still on medium heat.
Place tortilla on flat surface. Add eggs with cheese and bacon onto tortilla. Fold together to create a wrap so ingredients dont spill out. Place wrap fold side down on pan to create a seal. After 1 minute flip wrap over to brown other side. Serve hot.</steps>

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until fully incorporated. The mix might seem a little dry and tough to work with at first, but continue mixing until the ingredients start to incorporate, adding 1-2 tbsp (15-30 ml) of almond milk to soften it up, if needed.
Using a heaping tablespoon, roll the dough between your hands to form individual balls. Set them aside on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and repeat with the remaining dough.
To prepare the chocolate drizzle, melt the chocolate chips in the microwave or over a double broiler, stirring periodically to ensure no clumps remain. Use a spoon to drizzle the chocolate over each ball, and sprinkle with any desired toppings.
Refrigerate for ~15 minutes, or until the chocolate has set. Store the bites in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.</steps>

1/4 cup olive oil (or melted coconut oil)
1 tablespoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</ingredients>
    <steps>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line several large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
 Trim the carrot tops off. Starting on the thick end slice the carrots paper-thin on the bias to create elongated slices. You can do this with a chefs knife, but it’s better to use a mandolin slicer on the smallest setting. When you get down to the thin end, stop and save them to use in soup or salad.
Place the carrot slices in a large bowl and add the oil, salt, cumin, and cinnamon. Toss well to thoroughly coat. Then lay the slices in a single layer on the baking sheets.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges start to curl up and turn crisp. Then flip all the chip over and bake another 5-8 minutes to crisp the bottoms. Once cool, store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.</steps>

    <ingredients>1/2 pound bacon
3 russet potatoes (extra large, peeled and chopped into 1/2"-3/4" pieces, about 6 cups worth)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (or Mexican blend shredded cheeses)
3 green onions (sliced thin)</ingredients>
    <steps>COOK THE BACON: Spread the bacon strips out across a large rimmed baking sheet pan and place on the middle rack of a COLD oven. Set the temperature to 400 degrees. Set a timer for 16 minutes and check the bacon. Remove it from the oven when it is as crisp or crunchy as you like. I remove ours at 18 minutes and its a great balance of chewy crunch. If you like your bacon crispy enough to crumble, you will probably want to cook it another minute past that.
COOK THE POTATOES: While the bacon is cooking, peel and chop the potatoes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate to drain. There should be 2-3 tablespoons of bacon grease left on the sheet pan. (If there is more than that, drain off a bit.) Put the potatoes on the pan and toss with tongs to thoroughly coat them in the bacon grease. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes out in a single layer and bake for 20 minutes, stir well and bake an additional 20 minutes. Stir again, making sure that none of the potatoes are sticking to the tray. Bake another 15 minutes.

    <ingredients>1 tablespoon olive oil (or oil of choice)
2 teaspoons ginger (freshly grated (or 1 teaspoon dried ground ginger))
2 cloves garlic (minced, or 1/2 teaspoon dried ground)
2 carrots (small (or about 1/2 cup) chopped in smaller thin pieces so it cooks quickly)
1 head broccoli (chopped into small florets, you can also use some of the peeled stem if you chop into small pieces so that it cooks quickly)
salt (to taste)
pepper (to taste)
1 tablespoon water
1 cup brown rice (cooked)
1 teaspoon curry powder (or to taste for your desired heat level)
1 cup fresh spinach (chopped, optional)</ingredients>
    <steps>Make sure you have all of your items chopped and ready to go as this recipe is going to go fast. In a wok or frying pan, add your oil and heat to medium high heat. Add your fresh ginger and garlic (please note if you are using dried ground ginger and garlic add these only after you have added your vegetables to the wok) and stir fry just until aromatic then quickly add your carrots and broccoli. Keep stirring and keep the items in your wok moving. Add salt and pepper to taste and add 1 tablespoon of water and put on lid for about 1 minute, just to do a flash steam of your veggies. DO NOT overcook. You want your vegetables to be crisp aldente. (You can use any vegetables you have in your crisper for this recipe)

2Remove lid from your wok/frying pan and toss your veggies. The water should be evaporated. Add the cooked brown rice and curry powder and toss until all of the rice is well coated. (If your rice starts to stick then add just a touch more olive oil). Add a handful of spinach and just toss until wilted about 1 minute. Taste test your stir fry and adjust seasoning as desired.</steps>

    <ingredients>8 ounces (1 small-to-medium bundle, 225 grams) fresh broccoli (3 cups chopped)
1 large egg
1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (30 grams) finely grated parmesan cheese
1 small clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt, plus more to taste
A pinch of red pepper flakes or several grinds of black pepper
Olive or vegetable oil for frying</ingredients>
    <steps>In the bottom of a large bowl, lightly beat your egg. Add the flour, cheese, garlic, salt and pepper. Then, add the somewhat cooled broccoli and, using a potato masher, mash the broccoli just a bit. You’re looking to keep the bits recognizable, but small enough (1/4- to 1/2-inch chunks) that you can press a mound of the batter into a fritter in the pan. Once mashed a bit, stir or fold the ingredients together the rest of the way with a spoon. Adjust seasonings to taste.</steps>

    <steps>In a medium skillet (cast iron preferred), heat canola oil over medium.
Add chopped potatoes to the skillet in an even layer. Allow to pan fry in the oil for a handful of minutes, or until the potatoes start to brown. Basically you are going to flip the potatoes around to all sides for as even of a browning as you can get. Allow each side to brown before moving them around. I practice my patience when I do this. Recognize that each potato may cook at different times.
Using a slotted spoon, transfer potatoes to a plate lined with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt, parsley (optional) and cheese (optional).</steps>

    <ingredients>1 sheet frozen puff pastry sheets (defrosted, such as Pepperidge Farms)
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 garlic cloves (minced)
6 ounces fresh spinach (chopped or torn into pieces)
pepper (Sat &amp;, to taste)
1 1/2 ounces parmesan cheese
1 ounce feta cheese crumbles</ingredients>
    <steps>On a clean, dry surface sprinkle a small amount of flour to prevent sticking and lay down your sheet of defrosted puff pastry. Using a rolling pin, roll the pastry into a 10”x14” rectangle of even thickness.
In a large skillet or saute pan, bring the olive oil to medium heat. Add the garlic and allow garlic to cook for about a minute. Add the spinach and stir together. Allow the spinach to cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally until wilted. Add a couple shakes of your salt &amp; pepper shakers (or to taste). Spread the spinach evenly across the surface of the rolled out puff pastry sheet. Sprinkle the Parmesan and Feta cheeses evenly over top of the spinach, covering the entire surface of the pastry.
With the longer side of the pastry rectangle facing you, roll the pastry by pushing forward, wrapping the ingredients into a long roll. Once the pastry is completely rolled up into a big “log,” wrap it in parchment paper or cling wrap and place it in the freezer for 30-40 minutes. This will make it easier to cut into circles.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
When you take the pastry roll out of the freezer, use a serrated knife to slice it into 24 even “spirals.” I find the easiest way to do this evenly is to cut the roll in half, then each of those pieces into quarters, then cut each of those pieces into thirds. Place each spiral onto the parchment lined baking sheet and bake them in the oven for 20 minutes or until lightly golden. Serve warm.</steps>
